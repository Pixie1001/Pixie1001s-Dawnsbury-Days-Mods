  <property name="EncounterDescription">When a breeding pair cannot be found for one of the Echidna's creations, her flock steps forward in their place, enacting sacred rites and languishing in sacred pools so they might carry new life into the gene pool.

Though once a rare and deeply sacred ritual carried out only by the highest of her clergy, the ritual has become commonplace. Not to preserve endangered phenotypes, but to raise an army.
