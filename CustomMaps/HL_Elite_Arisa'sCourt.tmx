  <property name="EncounterDescription">Though the crawling denizens of the Demon Queen of Spider's domain now lurk in every corner or the Below, rumours speak of a sunken castle from the era of old that now serves as their sinister nest.

And at its centre, between you and the layline, the court of the demon Arisa, who designs herself a princess - beckoning her spidery subjects to entrap her enemies so that she might pass judgement on the behalf of her queen.
