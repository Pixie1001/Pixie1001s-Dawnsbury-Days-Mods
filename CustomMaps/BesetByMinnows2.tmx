  <property name="EncounterDescription">The party's journey is interrupted by a flooded passage. An unfortunate but not altogether unexpected occurrence down in the twisting caves of the Below.

With no other choice, they gather their potions of water breathing and begin to dredge down into the murky depths, wary of corrupted merfolk and other aquatic predators.

Piercing and slashing weapons are less effective when fighting underwater, and creatures without a swim speed are permanently flat footed and move at half speed. The party would be wise to equip themselves accordingly.
