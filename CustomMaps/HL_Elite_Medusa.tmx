  <property name="EncounterDescription">Legends speak of a cold hearted champion of the Echidna who terrorises the woods and royal hunting grounds, turning would be hunters, who would dare to poach her goddess' creations, into the hunted - leaving behind gardens of eerie statues fashioned from their petrified remains as macabre moniker.

Now, the huntress hunts you.
