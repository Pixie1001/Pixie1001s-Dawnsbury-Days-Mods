  <property name="EncounterDescription">The echidnadites often use tribes of kobalds as scouts or proxies for their schemes, keeping their adorable auxiliaries in line via a great beast, in which the simple minded kobalds worship as a god.

If the party is to continue unseen, the cult must be blinded. The beast must be slain.
